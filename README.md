# BashOut: A Forward-only Writing App

BashOut is a minimalist writing tool designed to help you focus on writing by providing a clean interface and tracking your word count. It comes in two flavors, both designed to work seamlessly across platforms:

1. [CLI Version](docs/bash-version.adoc): A lightweight Bash script that runs in any Unix-like terminal (macOS, Linux)
2. [GUI Version](docs/gui-version.md): A cross-platform PyQt5-based desktop application (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## Quick Starts

### Terminal Version
```bash
chmod +x bashout.sh styles.sh
./bashout.sh
```
### GUI Version
```bash
pip install PyQt5
python3 bashout_gui.py
```

## Philosophy

BashOut is designed to help you focus on writing by:
- Providing a clean, distraction-free interface
- Tracking your word count
- Encouraging forward-only writing
- Automatically saving your work
