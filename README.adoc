= BashOut: A Simple Writing App Script

BashOut is a simple Bash script designed to help you focus on writing by providing a clean interface and tracking your word count.
It offers inspirational banners, notes, and style prompts to get your creative juices flowing.

== Installation and Setup

.  Fork and clone this repository.

.  Make the scripts executable:
+
```bash
chmod +x /path/to/bashout.sh /path/to/styles.sh
```

== Usage

The script can be started in two ways; <<interactive mode>> and <<automatic mode>>.

=== Interactive mode

The interactive mode will prompt you to choose a banner style.

.  Run the script:
+
```
./bashout.sh
```
+
You will be presented with a menu to choose a banner style:
+
1 - Inspirational quote:: Displays a random quote from `resources/quotes.txt`. Feel free to add more quotes to this file.

2 - Note:: Prompts you to enter a note, which is then displayed as the banner.
There is no length limit to the note.

3 -  Style prompt:: Generates a random writing style prompt. For example:
+
```bash
Create a uplifting, steadily-paced story with an informal voice in past-tense from a second-person point of view.
```

[NOTE]
====
If you enter an invalid menu option, the writing interface will still launch but the banner will show:

```bash
No banner available.
```
====

=== Automatic mode

Automatic mode takes the banner choice as an argument from the invocation command, bypassing the menu.

. Run the script:
+
```bash
./bashout.sh <N>
```
+
Where `<N>` is the number of the banner style you want as listed in the previous section.
For example:
+
```bash
./bashout.sh 1
```
+
This command would launch the script with the inspirational quote banner style.

[NOTE]
====
If you pass an invalid argument, the writing interface will still launch but the banner will show:

```bash
No banner available.
```
====

== Writing interface

While in the writing interface, the script:

. Clears the screen.

. Displays the chosen banner.

. Displays the last sentence you wrote (if any).

. Shows your session and total word counts.

. Prompts you for a new sentence.

== Writing text

. Type (and edit) your text as you normally would.

. When you finish a line or a paragraph, press the `[Enter]` key.
The script will:
+
.. Clear your text from the interface.

.. Save it to a local file (`~/Documents/output.txt`).

.. Update the last sentence display with the latest entry.

.. Increment the total and session word counts appropriately.

. The interface will be clear and ready for further text to be typed.

. To exit the script, press `Ctrl+C`.
Be sure to hit `[Enter]` before you do to save your latest input.

== Configuration and Customization

=== `.gitignore`

By default, the `resources/` directory (except for `quotes.txt`) directory is ignored by Git.

=== Banner Color

Change the banner text color by modifying a `printf` command in `bashout.sh`.
For example, to change to red:

```bash
printf "\e[91m%s\e[0m\n" "$BANNER"
```

Refer to an ANSI escape code chart for other color codes.

=== Other Tweaks

Custom Banners:: Add more banner options by creating new text files in the `resources` directory and updating the `case` statement in `bashout.sh`.

Modifying Style Prompts:: Edit the lists in `styles.sh` (e.g., `voicelist`, `tonelist`) to customize the generated prompts.

Saving Location:: Change the `SAVE_FILE` variable in `bashout.sh` to save your writing to a different location.

Resetting Word Count:: To reset the total word count, delete or move `work/output.txt`.
The script will create a new file on next run.
The session word count always starts at zero.
